# Bank-Application
My first java project
This project demonstrates a simple banking application which includes 5 options namely:
- Checking Account balance
- Making a deposit
- MAking a withdrawal
- Checking the previous transaaction
- Quitting the Application

To create an account, an instance of the Account constructor should be created which takes in Account name and Account ID as inputs, then the showMenu function
can be called to show all options that the customer can perform.
